# Ruins Escapade

This is a very basic dungeon crawler game I made for my Intro to Computing project.
This game is inspired by [Legend of Zelda](http://www.zelda.com).

This game is written in C++ and uses [SDL 2](http://www.libsdl.org).

#### [Working Demo](https://youtu.be/56loejYyuwU)

## Dependencies
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
```
For other OS and environments, visit [Lazy Foo' Productions - Hello SDL](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php)

## Playing the game
```bash
$ make
$ ./ruinsescapade
```

After finishing, you can run
```bash
$ make clean
```
to cleanup the installation
